# Contacts Api
Sample express api with an in-memory database.

## Getting started
In order to run the application simply clone the repo and do an `npm install` and `npm run start:dev` to spin up a local server at port 3000.

## Endpoints
This restful api has the basic CRUD endpoints for getAll, getById, create, update, delete. All but the delete endpoint should return a json response relative to the contact.
